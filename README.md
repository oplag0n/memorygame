## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The Game description and how to play

This is a classic memory game for one player. The player can always open two cards at a time and try to match them. He is times and gets a score rating via stars depending on how many rounds he needs to complete the game. If the player reaches the end of the game in 18 rounds he gets three stars. In less than 28 rounds he still gets 2 stars. The goal of the game is to finish as fast as possible, with as little moves as possible. 

## The Author

Using the starter pack of Udacity the author of the full game functionality is Christoph. He has created this game as an Exercis for the FEND Degree. 

## Installation 

Follow the instructions on Github to clone the repository. In the main folder open the index.html file with your preffered browser to start the game. 

## Required Dependencies 

This game runs in plain JavaScript. There are no dependencies.
